## Introduction
 We aim to provide a user-friendly platform accessible to everyone, offering a preliminary assessment of mental health through an interactive self-assessment or quiz . By doing so, we're addressing the barriers that prevent individuals from seeking help. Real-life examples include instances where individuals experience stress, anxiety, or depression but are hesitant to seek professional help due to the fear of being judged or the inability to afford therapy sessions. This hesitation often leads to worsening mental health conditions and a decrease in overall well-being.
